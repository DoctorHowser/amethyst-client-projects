## Overview & Story
Wendy is a retiered EC Teacher and Candi is her daughter.
They have a MN Grant, and part of their deliverables is an App!

Early Childhood Education is as much about educating parents as it is chidren. Baby Know is a current program that works with High Schoolers and Young Parents to help them learn how to interact and enjoy working with their kids.


## Opportunity
They want a webapp to help manage the course. The course is 52 Modules (1 per week) of 2 videos each. They need a way to manage the videos, have accountability for students watching videos, and offer a platform to engage parents in their childs development.

Parents/Students need a way to watch videos, upload pictures/videos for engagement with the content.
Teachers/Advisors need a way to track that videos are being watched. Also a way to push students to complete modules.
Admins/Instructors need a way to manage modules & content.

Ideally they want some evidence of this programs succcess to be able to continue to get grants and grow the app further.
