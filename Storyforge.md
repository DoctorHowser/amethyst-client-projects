## Overview & Story
Getting work published, or even receiving feedback from a publisher, is difficult for any author. And it’s even more difficult if you aren’t white, straight, and cisgender. That’s why we created StoryForge — because there are amazing stories out there that aren’t being heard. StoryForge is a platform where writers can share their work, read others’ work, and give and receive feedback.

## Opportunity
Storyforge wants a Fullstack Beta of the Circle Workflow, the crux of the experience. Writers either start or join a circle, which is a private group for sharing written manuscripts. Circle members can access writtin work, leave comments. 

Comments are threaded! Comments to comments / replys. 

Circle owners are moderators, managing invites, kicking users from circle. 

## Users

## NOTE
This is a technical client -- they have APIs they are developing and can answer very technical qs. We are not obligated to use their stuff for the app, but if we dont, we will want to make sure our client code adheres as close as we can to what their apis expect.
