## Overview & Story
Live Shopping is a Phenomenon that started in 2010 in China and has exploded to a $171B market. This is QVC for a modern age and generations. People tune into streams of shoppers who present items, talk about them, model them, etc. Shoppers can buy in real time, ask questions.

Omi Live Shopping is a green-product focused platform. They want to get eco-conscious Gen Z buyers to adopt this style of shopping.


## Opportunity
Omi Live Shopping is a new startup looking for a POC app to help them get their community started. The Platform needs to incorporate a video/camera stream, a product HUD and 'playlist' and a live chat. Kinda similar to the idea of twitch. 

Streaming is flexible, they prefer an inhouse solution, but are open to integrating with Youtube, Twitch if needed.

They would ideally like to be able to save the streams afterward for an archive of old episodes.
